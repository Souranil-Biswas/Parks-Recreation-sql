# Parks-Recreation-sql
A fun SQL project based on the Parks and Recreation show. It covers data cleaning, JOINs, CTEs, window functions, CASE statements, and temporary tables to analyze employee demographics, salaries, and departments. Great for practicing real-world SQL skills with a fictional dataset.
